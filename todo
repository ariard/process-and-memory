ns_of_pid() : returns the pid namespace in which the specified pid was allocated

TODO :
	-> show all fields struct pid_info *ret = {
	pid : 				pid_t		pid
	pointer to process'stack : 	void		*stack;	
	state of the process :		volatile long	state
	age of processs : 		u64  		start_time
	array child/siblings  process :	list_head	children, siblings			
	parent pid :			task_struct	real_parent
	root path process :		fs_struct	fs->root
	cwd :				fs_struct	fs->pwd
	};



-> is a way to RO address stack ? seems absurd
